#+TITLE: My Configuration Files

This repository holds my config files (apart from my .emacs which lives
[[https://github.com/georgek/dot-emacs][here]]).

* Usage

I find it convenient to use GNU stow to make symlinks to files in this repo.
For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone <this> ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  stow bash
#+END_SRC

Now everything inside bash is symlinked from the directory above ~/.dotfiles.

Inspired by [[https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/][this post]].
